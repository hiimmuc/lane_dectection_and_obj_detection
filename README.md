# lane_dectection_and_obj_detection
our project purpose is to provide roburst algorithm for self driving car including advanced lane detection and object detection<br />
lane detection we got the referencr from  https://github.com/windowsub0406/Advanced-lane-finding<br />
in object detection part, we got the dataset from https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/self-driving-car <br />
all trained model and config files can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SOdIlqje7FUuDwFLq-caMVovpxj1-qzh?usp=sharing<br />
